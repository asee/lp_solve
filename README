This LPSolve interface library uses DL to dynamically load the LPSolve library.  It will look for the library in the lib/binaries folder, and searches
for the first library it can load in this order:

liblpsolve55.dylib
liblpsolve55.dylib-ppc
liblpsolve55.dylib.x86-64
liblpsolve55.so
liblpsolve55.so-ux64
lpsolve55.dll


You can download and compile the liblpsolve library from http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/

NOTE:  As this started as an internal project, only support for binary variable types is supported.  It sounds not-functional, but it fit my purposes.
For example, to get the lowest cost fruit salad which has at least one fruit everyone likes look at demo.rb
